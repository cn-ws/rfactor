cripts to compute and analyse the R-factor of the RUSLE-equation. The
R-factor is a measure for the total erosivity of a number of rainfall events
within a defined timeframe (year, month, number of days). The factor is
computed by calculating the yearly sum of -for every rainfall event- the sum
of the depth of rainfall (mm) and the kinetic energy, and taking the mean
over all years. For the formula's, we refer to the CN-WS Pascal model
documentation:
